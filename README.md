# RubyUI (former PhlexUI) 🚀

Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can generate or copy and paste into your apps.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.

### Key Features:

- **Built for Speed** ⚡: RubyUI leverages Phlex, which is up to 12x faster than traditional Rails ERB templates.
- **Stunning UI** 🎨: Design beautiful, streamlined, and customizable UIs that sell your app effortlessly.
- **Stay Organized** 📁: Keep your UI components well-organized and easy to manage.
- **Customer-Centric UX** 🧑‍💼: Create memorable app experiences for your users.
- **Completely Customizable** 🔧: Full control over the design of all components.
- **Minimal Dependencies** 🍃: Uses custom-built Stimulus.js controllers to keep your app lean.
- **Reuse with Ease** ♻️: Build components once and use them seamlessly across your project.

### How to Use:

1. **Find the perfect component** 🔍: Browse live-embedded components on our documentation page.
2. **Copy the snippet** 📋: Easily copy code snippets for quick implementation.
3. **Make it yours** 🎨: Customize components using Tailwind utility classes to fit your specific needs.
